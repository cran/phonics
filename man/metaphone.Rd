\title{Generate phonetic versions of strings with Metaphone}
\usage{
metaphone(word, maxCodeLen = 10L, clean = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{word}{string or vector of strings to encode}

\item{maxCodeLen}{maximum length of the resulting encodings, in characters}

\item{clean}{if \code{TRUE}, return \code{NA} for unknown alphabetical characters}
}
\value{
a character vector containing the metaphones of \code{word},
or an NA if the \code{word} value is NA
}
\description{
The function \code{metaphone} phonentically encodes the
given string using the metaphone algorithm.
}
\details{
There is some discrepency with respect to how the metaphone algorithm
actually works. For instance, there is a version in the Java Apache
Commons library.  There is a version provided within PHP. These do
not provide the same results.  On the questionable theory that the
implementation in PHP is probably more well known, this code should
match it in output.

This implementation is based on a Javascript implementation which is
itself based on the PHP internal implementation.

The variable \code{maxCodeLen} is the limit on how long the returned
metaphone should be.

The \code{metaphone} algorithm is only defined for inputs over the
standard English alphabet, \emph{i.e.}, "A-Z.". Non-alphabetical
characters are removed from the string in a locale-dependent fashion.
This strips spaces, hyphens, and numbers.  Other letters, such as
"Ãœ," may be permissible in the current locale but are unknown to
\code{metaphone}.  For inputs outside of its known range, the output
is undefined and \code{NA} is returned and a \code{warning} this
thrown.  If \code{clean} is \code{FALSE}, \code{metaphone} attempts
to process the strings.  The default is \code{TRUE}.
