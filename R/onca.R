#' @description
#' The Oxford Name Compression Algorithm name coding procedure
#'
#' @param word string or vector of strings to encode
#' @param maxCodeLen   maximum length of the resulting encodings, in characters
#' @param clean if \code{TRUE}, return \code{NA} for unknown alphabetical characters
#' @param modified if \code{TRUE}, use the modified \code{nysiis} function
#' @param refined if \code{TRUE}, use the \code{refinedSoundex} function
#'
#' @details
#'
#' The variable \code{word} is the name to be encoded.  The variable
#' \code{maxCodeLen} is the limit on how long the returned name code
#' should be.  The default is 4.
#'
#' The \code{onca} algorithm is only defined for inputs over the
#' standard English alphabet, \emph{i.e.}, "A-Z.". Non-alphabetical
#' characters are removed from the string in a locale-dependent fashion.
#' This strips spaces, hyphens, and numbers.  Other letters, such as
#' "Ãœ," may be permissible in the current locale but are unknown to
#' \code{onca}.  For inputs outside of its known range, the output is
#' undefined and \code{NA} is returned and a \code{warning} this thrown.
#' If \code{clean} is \code{FALSE}, \code{onca} attempts to process the
#' strings.  The default is \code{TRUE}.
#'
#' @return the ONCA encoded character vector

onca <- function(word, maxCodeLen = 4, clean = TRUE, modified = FALSE, refined = FALSE) {

    ## Yes, it really is this simple, but maxCodeLen * 2 is kind of eyeballing it
    word <- nysiis(word, maxCodeLen = maxCodeLen * 2, clean = clean)
    if(refined)
        word <- refinedSoundex(word, maxCodeLen, clean = clean)
    else
        word <- soundex(word, maxCodeLen, clean = clean)
    
    return(word)
