#' @description
#' The Soundex phonetic algorithms
#'
#' @param word string or vector of strings to encode
#' @param maxCodeLen  maximum length of the resulting encodings, in characters
#' @param clean if \code{TRUE}, return \code{NA} for unknown alphabetical characters
#'
#' @details The function \code{soundex} phonentically encodes the given
#' string using the soundex algorithm.  The function \code{refinedSoundex}
#' uses Apache's refined soundex algorithm.  Both implementations are loosely
#' based on the Apache Commons Java editons.
#'
#' The variable \code{maxCodeLen} is the limit on how long the returned
#' soundex should be.
#'
#' The \code{soundex} and \code{revisedSoundex} algorithms are only
#' defined for inputs over the standard English alphabet, \emph{i.e.},
#' "A-Z." Non-alphabetical characters are removed from the string in a
#' locale-dependent fashion.  This strips spaces, hyphens, and numbers.
#' Other letters, such as "Ãœ," may be permissible in the current locale
#' but are unknown to \code{soundex} and \code{revisedSoundex}.  For
#' inputs outside of its known range, the output is undefined and
#' \code{NA} is returned and a \code{warning} this thrown.  If
#' \code{clean} is \code{FALSE}, \code{soundex} and
#' \code{revisedSoundex} attempts to process the strings.  The default
#' is \code{TRUE}.
#'
#' @return soundex encoded character vector
#'
#' @section Caveats:
#' The \code{soundex} and \code{refinedSoundex} algorithms are only
#' defined for inputs over the standard English alphabet, \emph{i.e.},
#' "A-Z." For inputs outside this range, the output is undefined.
