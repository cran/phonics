#' @title Lein Name Coding
#'
#' @description
#' The Lein name coding procedure.
#'
#' @param word string or vector of strings to encode
#' @param maxCodeLen   maximum length of the resulting encodings, in characters
#' @param clean if \code{TRUE}, return \code{NA} for unknown alphabetical characters
#' 
#' @details
#'
#' The variable \code{word} is the name to be encoded.  The variable
#' \code{maxCodeLen} is the limit on how long the returned name code
#' should be.  The default is 4.
#'
#' The \code{lein} algorithm is only defined for inputs over the
#' standard English alphabet, \emph{i.e.}, "A-Z.". Non-alphabetical
#' characters are removed from the string in a locale-dependent fashion.
#' This strips spaces, hyphens, and numbers.  Other letters, such as
#' "Ãœ," may be permissible in the current locale but are unknown to
#' \code{lein}.  For inputs outside of its known range, the output is
#' undefined and \code{NA} is returned and a \code{warning} this thrown.
#' If \code{clean} is \code{FALSE}, \code{lein} attempts to process the
#' strings.  The default is \code{TRUE}.
#'
#' @return the Lein encoded character vector
