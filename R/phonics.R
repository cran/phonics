#' Encode words with English-language Metaphone
#'
#' The phonics package provides an implementation of the Metaphone
#' phonetic algorithm in R.  The algorithm reduces a string to a
#' symbolic representation approximating the sound.  It can be used to
#' match names, words, and as a proxy for assorted string distance
#' algorithms.
