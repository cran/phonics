The ``phonics`` package for R is designed to provide a variety of
phonetic indexing algorithms in common and not-so-common use today.  The
algorithms generally reduce a string to a symbolic representation
approximating the sound made by pronouncing the string.  They can be
used to match names, words, and as a proxy for assorted string distance
algorithms.

# Basic Usage 

All algorithms, except the Match Rating Approach, accept a character
vector or vector of character vectors as the input.  These are converted
to their phonetic spelling using the relevant algorithm.  For example,
we shall consider the Soundex and Refined Soundex algorithms.  The
Soundex algorithm is implemented as the ``soundex`` function and the
Refined Soundex method is given in the ``refinedSoundex`` function, and
we can observe them in the following examples.

```{r basic-examples}
library("phonics")

x1 <- "Catherine"
x2 <- "Kathryn"
x3 <- "Katrina"
x4 <- "William"

x <- c(x1, x2, x3, x4)

soundex(x1)
soundex(x2)
soundex(x)

refinedSoundex(x1)
refinedSoundex(x2)
```

Both functions accept a `maxCodeLen` that limits the length of the
returned code.  Except where noted, all the algorithms support the
`maxCodeLen` option to change the maximum or expected code length
returned, as appropriate.

Beyond soundex, additional algorithms are available, as shown in the
following table.

# Match Rating Approach

Unlike other algorithms described here, MRA is a two-stage algorithm
with separate encoding and comparison routines.  For instance, the
results of Soundex on two different strings can be directly compared to
test for equality:

```{r soundex-test-example}
soundex(x1) == soundex(x2)
soundex(x2) == soundex(x3)
```

However, the MRA encoding algorithm may return different encodings for
similar strings that should match.  So the second stage, for comparison,
is used to compare to MRA-encoded strings. The encoding algorithm is
provided by `mra_encode` and the comparison algorithm is provided by
`mra_compare`.

```{r mra-example}
(mra1 = mra_encode("Katherine"))
(mra2 = mra_encode("Catherine"))
(mra3 = mra_encode("Katarina"))

mra_compare(mra1, mra2)
mra_compare(mra1, mra3)
mra_compare(mra2, mra3)
```

The threshold necessary to establish similarity _gets smaller_ as the
encoded strings get larger.  This leads to some interesting results.
For instance, Catherine and William match as names.

```{r mra-kw-example}
mra_compare(mra_encode("Catherine"), mra_encode("William"))
```

# Summary

This paper has outlined the `phonics` package for R.  Included in this
package are several English-, German-, and French-language suitable
algorithms for phonetically reducing names and strings.  These can be
used for comparison and indexing, as well as later record-linkage.
